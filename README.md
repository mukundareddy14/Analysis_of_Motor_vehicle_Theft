# Analysis_of_Motor_vehicle_Theft
This project aims to analyze and visualize trends in vehicle theft using a real-world dataset. By leveraging Pythonâ€™s data science libraries, we uncover patterns related to when, where, and what types of vehicles are most frequently stolen. The insights generated can help inform crime prevention strategies and improve situational awareness.
